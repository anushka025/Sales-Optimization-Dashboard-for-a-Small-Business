# Sales-Optimization-Dashboard-for-a-Small-Business

In 2020, I co-founded 'Manipal thrift' now 'Thrift Attic' , an online store with a reach of 1000+ members that aims to address the issue of environmental restoration by establishing a space for affordable fashion that is a combination of recreating and recycling.

 This dashboard has been meticulously crafted to enhance our understanding of critical aspects that drive our sales and inventory management decisions.

One of the standout features of this dashboard is its ability to analyze sales based on shipping locations, allowing us to pinpoint the regions with the highest sales volume. This valuable information helps us tailor our marketing and distribution strategies to optimize sales in specific areas.
Sales by Garment Category:

The dashboard provides a breakdown of sales by garment category, enabling us to identify which category is contributing the most to our overall revenue. This knowledge guides our product development and marketing efforts.
Sold vs. Unsold Item Ratio:

To maintain an efficient inventory, the dashboard also displays the ratio of sold to unsold items for each garment category. This insight assists us in optimizing stock levels, reducing excess inventory, and minimizing potential losses.
